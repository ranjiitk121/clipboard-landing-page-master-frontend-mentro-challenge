### What I learned
I shouldn't have started the desktop first in mind. I should have started with simple mobile layout without giving display flex to any container that actually didn't need it.
Of course, this lead really bad experience when I tried to make it work for desktop. In fact, it was so bad, I decided to not finish it!
However, I am gonna push this code, just remember mistakes that I can if I don't pay attention.
Sure, this is just a small project to brush up my skills, so I didn't pay much attention. However, I still would have like to make it better.
